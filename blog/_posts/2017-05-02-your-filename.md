## The Story Behind the Cobbler

Once upon a time, there was a child named the cobbler. The Cobbler had a humble upbringing, one of the common working romans. He grew up in a conclave near the eastern part of Sicily in 79 BC. since his birth he was an orphan. while he lived in the orphanage, his caregiver made him work - his job - repairing people's shoes.

Day in, and day out, he worked and worked on repairing shoes, from the senator’s to the soldier’s. Through his labor he learned the stories of many men and the problems they faced. Over time, more and more senators would come to him to get their shoes repaired and mended for he had the most skilled hands.

One day, when the Cobbler was 18, an ordinary looking man came into his shop asking to get his sandals fixed up. Cobbler fixed them up as well as he could, and when he was done the man was impressed. The man told the Cobbler that his real name was Mercurius, or rather Mercury, the god of commerce, messaging, and luck. As a payment for the Cobbler’s services Mercury blessed him with his metaphysical powers. Whether the man was telling the truth or not, business boomed for him. He grew many relationships with commoners, nobles, tribunes, praetorians, and soldiers. 

By the time he was 25, most of Rome had come to know the name “Cobbler”. When he was approaching the age of 31 he was distraught over the news of Pompey’s assassination. In this time of distress Julius Caesar snatched power from the hands of the people and became an emperor. Years passed, he perfected his craft and eventually grew tired of the monotony. Then when he was 35 years old, he got news that Caesar had been assassinated. In that moment, he knew what he had to do for the people of Rome. He would not let some noble seize power for themselves, he would run for the people of Rome. With his knowledge and wisdom delivered to him by the gods, and his understanding of the common people of Rome, he believes the he should have a chance at delivering the people of Rome from the grip of chaos.
