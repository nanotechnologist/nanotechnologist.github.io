Nanotechnology is a science where technology less than 100 nanometers is dealt with. Almost always meaning the modification of atoms and molecules.
Nanotechnologists work on tech from 100nm , to 0.1nm! That's pretty small!
Today, nanotechnologists work on nanomedicines, nanowires, and nanoparticles. Nanotechnology can be used in our devices to build the smaller pieces, and for work on even smaller devices. However, things like solar panels are being designed with nanoparticles.
A lot goes on with nanotechnology, but you don't always see it. Literally! :P
